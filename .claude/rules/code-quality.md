# Code quality: the house rules

These rules apply to every source file, test and template in every language, whoever writes it. The language rules (`node.md`, `java.md`, `playwright.md`, `gds.md`, `k6.md`) add to them. Where a guide under `docs/best-practices/` says otherwise, these rules win.

Review treats a breach as a defect to fix in the same change. "Taste", "pre-existing", "out of scope" and "a nearby file does it" are not reasons to keep one.

<!-- house-rules:start -->
**Comments**

- Write code that needs no comment. If a name or an extracted function can say it, rename or extract instead.
- A comment describes only the lines directly below it. Never describe callers, other modules, the backend, a library, the UI or a test. No counts: "the one row", "the only caller".
- Rationale goes in the repo's `docs/` or the behaviour spec, never in code.
- A comment that explains a name means the name is wrong. Rename, then delete the comment in the same change.
- When a comment is stale, delete it. Do not reword it.
- A marker that a test or tool reads, such as the machine-draft header on Welsh copy, is not a comment to delete.
- Doc comments (JSDoc, Javadoc) only state the contract of an exported public API. None on internal helpers.
- Bad: `// Hapi validates the full payload before route handlers run, so the token is guaranteed present.` Good: no comment. The route's `validate.payload` schema already says it.

**Ids and history**

- No ticket keys (`EUDPA-565`), backlog, ruling or acceptance-criteria ids (`c-201`, `inc-010`), release names ("Design Release 2.1") or session words ("the real service") in code, comments or test titles.
- No history. No before/after narration, no "renamed from", no `REMOVED_*` constants, no names like `…WhenTheDocumentWasWrittenBeforeTheChange`. Code states how things are now; git holds how they were.
- Prove a removal with an exact positive assertion. Bad: `expect(page.getByText(REMOVED_INTERNAL_REFERENCE_LIMIT)).toHaveCount(0)`. Good: `expect(field).toHaveAccessibleDescription(copy.internalReference.hint)`.

**Names**

- A name predicts what the code returns and what it changes. Read the body, then check the name told you both.
- A name says every kind of value the code can return, a fallback of another kind or a null included, and any error it throws as an expected outcome, such as not found or refused. A failure of a service it calls need not be named. An empty list or string is the same kind of value. It need not say when each one comes back. Bad: `countryNameOf(countries, code)`, which can return a code. Good: `countryLabelOf`, the label shown: the name, else the code; and `requestedPageOrFirst`. Too far: `honouredReturnOffAddressOrAddressBook`, which spells out when the address book wins.
- Rename only when the name mispredicts. A name that already says every kind of value the code returns, and what it changes, stays, even when another name would read better.
- Name a parameter or local for what it holds at that point. Bad: `id` and `returnTo` for an address id and a return that has passed its checks. Good: `addressId` and `honouredReturn`.
- Bad: `// c-201: an amendment opens with no errors; Continue refused shows them.` above `const holdsSilently = readOnly || (isAmend && !refused)`. Good: no comment, and a name that says the page hides answer errors for submitted, template and unrefused amend states.
- Bad: `linesDroppedBy(lines, type)` returning `{ kept, removed }`. Good: `keepLinesAllowedBy(lines, type)`.
- Bad: `report()` that also clears expired faults. Good: clear them where a name says so, and let `report()` only read.
- No metaphors. Bad: `lightenRemote()`. Good: `excludeGhPagesFromFetch()`.
- No positional boolean flags. Bad: `saveActions(true, false)`. Good: `saveActions({ readOnly: true })`.
- One concept, one name, from request header to repository and across twin repos. Bad: `User-Id`, `userId`, `ownerId` and "actor id" for one person.
- A rename covers the concept's whole vocabulary: keys, variables, copy keys, test titles. Search for the concept word, not only the old identifier.

**Structure**

- One rule, one owner: each display or business rule lives in one function, mirrored in each twin repo. Bad: three formatters for one port label.
- Extend the mechanism that exists. Do not add a second one beside it. When a new class or path mirrors one you are editing, extract the shared part in the same change.
- A pipeline whose callbacks branch or take several steps gets named helpers, so the top function reads as a few named steps.
- Build only what this change makes reachable.
- A literal value used by one function lives in that function. Module scope is for values the module shares, and for module set-up such as a logger, a template path or a value a test imports.
- A scope you are given limits which files you open, never which lines of an opened file you fix. Every file you touch meets these rules in full.

**Design**

- Build copy, layout and components as the design source sets them: the prototype, a design release or a ticket's acceptance criteria. Where a guide such as the GDS style guide disagrees, a review raises a `design` finding: the question for the designer, never a code fix. Code that differs from its design source is a correctness finding.

**Tests**

- Set-up used by two tests goes in the shared test helper. Promoting a helper deletes the local copies.
- A test title states what its assertions prove. Bad: titled "flips status to submitted" while asserting `SUBMITTED_ACTION_REQUIRED`.
- A test must fail without the change it covers.
- Test behaviour through inputs and outputs. Mock only at the boundary the code does not own: the network, the database, the filesystem, the clock. Never mock your own modules. No spy assertions (`toHaveBeenCalledWith`) unless the call is itself the external side effect.
- Fix a flaky assertion. Never delete or loosen it, and never add a test only to raise coverage.

**Logging and errors**

- Every branch that changes an outcome (refusal, redirect, retry, fallback, state switch) logs once, with the ids support searches by. A user's own input error shown back on the form is not one: do not log it. Another service refusing what this one accepted is: log it at warn.
- Log the throwable (Java) or `{ err }` (pino), never only its message. Bad: `log.warn("Retryable error, message left for retry: {}", classified.getMessage())`. Good: `log.warn("Retryable error, message {} left for retry", messageId, classified)`.
- No request or response bodies at INFO.
- No empty catch. `.catch(() => undefined)` hides the failure it swallows.
