# Address book pages

The designer says: "change the address book", "add an address manually",
"let users delete an address", "change an address", "add a manual address
page to the address book", "address categories" or "sort addresses by what
they are used for".

**Before changing `ins-address-book`**, read
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-ins-frontend/src/server/app/services/address-book/`
(the real service this one copies) and
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-address-book/docs/openapi/api-contract.locked.yaml`
(the locked API contract behind it), so a change here never invents a shape
the real API does not have.

**Whose it is.** The address book belongs to the Import Notification Service
frontend (INS), not to plants. Plants-frontend only reads it
(`src/server/app/services/address-book/index.js`: `search` and `party`, and
it says so). In the real service the header's "Address book" link goes to
INS. In the prototype that link is deliberately dead everywhere and nothing
can point it at a real INS (see `references/run-the-prototype.md`). So
address book pages in a design release are flagged **"belongs to the Import
Notification Service frontend"**, and a hand-off says the change is for the
INS team, not plants-frontend. Say both to the designer in the opening line.

## What is there already

The prototype-owned service `src/server/app/services/ins-address-book/` is a
copy of the INS frontend's own address book service
(`repos/trade-imports-ins-frontend/src/server/app/services/address-book/`):
the same five operations, the same wire shape, the same
`TRADE_IMPORTS_ADDRESS_BOOK_URL`. Its stub refuses what the real address
book API refuses, with the API's own messages.

| Function                                         | Answers                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listAddresses(orgId, { page, q, countryCode })` | `{ items, page, pageSize, totalItems, totalPages }`, 25 to a page, as the API pages. Starts with the stub address book and the release's extra parties. |
| `getAddress(orgId, id)`                          | One address. Throws an error with `status: 404` when the organisation has none by that id.                                                              |
| `createAddress(orgId, body)`                     | Saves and returns the address, with an `id` made from its name. Any extra field (a `usages` list, say) is kept.                                         |
| `updateAddress(orgId, id, body)`                 | Lays the changes over the address and returns it.                                                                                                       |
| `deleteAddress(orgId, id)`                       | Deletes it (a starter address is hidden for that organisation until Reset).                                                                             |
| `isValidationFailure(error)`                     | True for the 400 a refused save throws.                                                                                                                 |
| `mapApiErrorsToFormErrors(error.body)`           | `{ field: message }`, the first message for each refused field.                                                                                         |

An address is in the INS wire shape: `name`, `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`,
`townOrCity`, `county`, `postcode`, `countryCode` (two letters, `GB` for the
United Kingdom), `phone`, `email`, `deleted`. The API requires `name`,
`addressLine1`, `townOrCity`, `postcode`, `countryCode`, `phone` and `email`,
and checks the email's format — confirm the required set and the format
checks against `api-contract.locked.yaml` before relying on it.

**The journey's pickers follow without any change.** Every address added,
changed or deleted through `ins-address-book` shows in the release's
consignor, consignee, place of destination and contact pickers, and on check
your answers, straight away. They keep importing the real
`services/address-book/index.js`: the prototype lays the release's changes
over the stub book it serves (`withExtraParties` in
`src/server/prototype-data/`). Never change a picker's import.

Added, changed and deleted addresses are kept per release, and per
organisation on the address book pages. Reset brings the starters back for
that release only.

## Where the imports come from

From a file in `src/server/app/sets/<release>/journeys/linear/features/<feature>/`:

| Import                  | Path                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The address book API    | `'../../../../../../services/ins-address-book/index.js'`                                                         |
| Countries for a select  | `'../../../../../../services/countries/index.js'` (`originCountries()`)                                          |
| Shared paths, kit, copy | `'../../../../../../shared/paths.js'`, `'../../../../../../shared/kit.js'`, `'../../../../../../shared/copy.js'` |
| The organisation        | `'../../../../../../../common/helpers/organisation-id.js'`                                                       |

## Step 1: the address book list

The pattern to copy is the saved transporters list in the placeholder set,
`src/server/app/sets/sample-journey/journeys/linear/features/saved-transporters/`
(`controller.js`, `view-model.js` and `list.njk`): a search form, a results
table with a "Delete" link per row, and pagination. Copy it into a new
feature `features/address-book/` in the release, then change it to the
address book:

```js
import * as addressBook from '../../../../../../services/ins-address-book/index.js'

const list = async (request, h) => {
  const query = String(request.query.q ?? '').trim()
  const found = await addressBook.listAddresses(organisationIdOf(request), {
    page: pageNumber(request.query.page),
    q: query
  })
  // found.items, found.totalItems, found.page, found.totalPages
}
```

Mount it at `'/address-book'`, so the page is
`http://localhost:3103/<release>/address-book`. Each row shows `name` and the
address lines joined (`addressLine1`, `townOrCity`, `postcode`), with the
country's name from `originLabel(countryCode)` in
`services/countries/index.js` (`United Kingdom` for `GB`). Add a success
banner for `?added=<id>` or `?deleted=1`
(`references/fake-a-service/success-banner.md`).

In `features/index.js`, add
`import * as addressBookPage from './address-book/controller.js'` and
`...addressBookPage.routes` to `allRoutes`, and put a link
to the page on the release's dashboard (`addressBookHref:
`${dashboardPath()}/address-book`` in the dashboard controller's view
model). The header's "Address book" link is shared layout and belongs to
the real service: leave it.

## Step 2: add an address by hand

`features/address-book-add/controller.js`, `GET` and `POST` on
`/address-book/add`. Copy `add.njk` and the add handlers from the saved
transporters example, and ask for the INS fields with the INS labels: name,
address line 1, address line 2 (optional), town or city, county (optional),
postcode, country, telephone number and email address. The field names are
the wire names above, so the form posts straight to `createAddress`.

- Country: a `govukSelect` named `countryCode`, with
  `{ value: 'GB', text: 'United Kingdom' }` first, then
  `await originCountries()`.
- `POST`: call `createAddress`. When it throws and `isValidationFailure`
  says so, render the form again with the values, `kit.errorSummary(errors)`
  and each field's message, and answer `400`. The messages come from the API
  (`mapApiErrorsToFormErrors`); to reword one, or to give the Welsh, put the
  page's own words in its copy keyed by field and use them first, as the
  saved transporters example does (`formErrorsFor` in its `view-model.js`).
- Without an error, land on the list with a banner:

  ```js
  const added = await addressBook.createAddress(
    organisationIdOf(request),
    values
  )
  return h.redirect(
    `${dashboardPath()}/address-book?added=${encodeURIComponent(added.id)}`
  )
  ```

  To come back to a picker instead (the designer went off to add an address
  from the consignor page), carry the page in a `returnTo` query and follow
  `references/fake-a-service/come-back-to-where-i-was.md`: the picker ticks
  the new address with `?selected=<id>`, and finds it, because the pickers
  see the change.

**Change an address.** The same form on `/address-book/{addressId}/change`,
filled from `getAddress`, saving with `updateAddress(orgId, id, values)`.
Give the `{addressId}` route an `addressIdParams` Joi object (with a
`failAction` that answers "not found", following
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-ins-frontend/src/server/app/features/address-book/address-id-params.js`),
so a stale or made-up id never reaches the handler.

**Find an address by postcode.** The old prototype had a lookup. There is no
address lookup service here, so build the manual form, and log a design gap:
"Find an address by postcode: needs a real service (an address lookup such as
OS Places); the prototype asks for the address by hand".

**Address categories** ("what is this address used for": consignor,
consignee, importer). The real address book has no types on purpose: the
same address can be a consignor on one notification and a consignee on the
next. To test the idea, add a `govukCheckboxes` named `usages` to the add
form. `createAddress` keeps the list on the record, and the list page can
show it or filter by it. Log it as a design gap that says the real address
book has no categories, so it needs a decision from the INS team, not only a
build. Add a line to `openQuestions` in the service's `contract.json` too.

## Step 3: "are you sure?" before deleting

Follow `references/fake-a-service/confirm-then-act.md`. The saved
transporters example has the page (`delete.njk` and `showDelete`/`remove` in
its `controller.js`). Use `getAddress` to find it (redirect to the list when
it throws a 404), `deleteAddress` to delete it, and land on the list with
`?deleted=1`. Copy:

```js
export const copy = {
  title: 'Are you sure you want to delete this address?',
  body: 'You will not be able to choose it on a new notification. Notifications that already use it keep it.',
  confirmButton: 'Delete address',
  noLink: 'No, go back'
}
```

## Check it

1. `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:check -- --set <release> --full`.
2. Picture the pages:

   ```bash
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:show -- --set <release> --pages dashboard,consignors/select --url address-book --url address-book/add --url "address-book/northgate-trading-ag/delete" --url "address-book?added=northgate-trading-ag" --errors --mobile --before
   ```

   `--errors` pictures the add form sent empty. The banner picture uses a
   starter's id, because a new address only exists once someone adds it.

3. Adding and then finding the address in a picker is a form sent and a page
   followed, which `designer:show` cannot drive. The service's own test
   proves the pickers follow (`ins-address-book.test.js`). Say the round
   trip was not clicked through.

## The design gaps rows

```text
| address-book | Address book pages: list, add by hand, change, delete with a check page | Prototype-owned service `ins-address-book` (`src/server/app/services/ins-address-book`), a copy of the INS frontend's API | Belongs to the Import Notification Service frontend: it owns the address book and is its only writer; plants-frontend only reads it. The INS team needs the design, not the plants team. | <frame> |
```

and, when built, one row each for the postcode lookup and address categories
as described above.
