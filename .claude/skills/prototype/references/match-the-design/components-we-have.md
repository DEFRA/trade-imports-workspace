# Components we have

Every component a page in this prototype can use, with the line that imports
it and a template that already uses it. Copy the shape from that template.

A component is only fully usable when three things are true:

1. Its macro is installed (every entry below).
2. Its styles are loaded by `src/client/stylesheets/application.scss`. All
   GOV.UK Frontend styles are loaded. Of MoJ Frontend, only the date picker's
   styles are loaded.
3. If it has a script, the script is started in
   `src/client/javascripts/application.js`. Both files belong to the real
   service, so a designer cannot start a new script or load new styles. Ask
   for it as a design gap.

All three files are inside
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/`.

## What "Script NOT started" means on the page

These components still render, but behave as they do with JavaScript turned
off. Use them only if that is good enough for the design, and say so in the
gap log if it is not.

- `govukTabs`: shows a list of links to each panel, then every panel one after
  another. It does not look like tabs. For a dashboard with tabs, see
  `layout-patterns.md`.
- `govukAccordion`: every section is open, with no "Show all sections" button.
- `govukCharacterCount`: the textarea and its hint show, but the count does not
  update as you type.
- `govukPasswordInput`: no "Show" button.
- `govukFileUpload`: a plain file input, without the drop zone.
- `govukExitThisPage`: the button is a plain link.
- `govukNotificationBanner`: shows normally. Only the move of focus to a
  success banner is missing.
- MoJ `add-another`, `alert`, `button-menu` and `multi-file-upload`: their
  styles are not loaded either, so they are not usable at all.

`govukDetails` needs no script: it is a native HTML `<details>` element and
works everywhere.

## What "Styles NOT loaded" means

The macro renders plain, unstyled HTML. Every MoJ component except the date
picker is in this state, including the filter layout, sub navigation, badge,
timeline, ticket panel, button menu and the MoJ task list. Never use them. See
`nearest-equivalent.md` for the GOV.UK option to build instead.

## Keeping this list up to date

The part below the line is generated from what is installed in the prototype
repo. When `govuk-frontend` or `@ministryofjustice/frontend` changes version
in the prototype's `package.json` (the weekly update does this), refresh it.
This script lives in the workspace but inspects the prototype's tree, so it
takes the prototype's path as `--root` and is the one reference in this skill
run with a bare `node` command:

```bash
node ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/.claude/skills/prototype/references/match-the-design/scripts/components-we-have.js --write --root ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype
```

Without `--write`, the command prints the list and changes nothing.

## Pieces every journey page shares

These are not components but every journey template uses them. See
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/docs/designers/gov-uk/templates-in-this-prototype.md`
for what each does.

- `{% include "shared/error-summary.njk" %}`
- `{% from "shared/section-caption.njk" import sectionCaption %}`
