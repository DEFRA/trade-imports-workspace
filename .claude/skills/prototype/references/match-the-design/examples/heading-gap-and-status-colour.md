# Worked example: a spacing ask and a colour ask

This is what a good run of `references/match-the-design.md` looks like for
two common asks. Use it to check your own mapping.

## The ask

The designer, working in their release `plants-working`, says:

> On the dashboard, reduce the gap under the heading to 10px and make the
> status blue. Here is the Figma frame: `dashboard-v4.png`.

## 1. Whose file is it?

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:where -- src/server/app/sets/plants-working/journeys/linear/features/dashboard/template.njk
```

The answer starts "Yours: safe to change." Carry on. (Had it named
`high-risk-plants`, the reference would stop and offer the release or
`references/hand-off.md`.)

## 2. The starting pair

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:show -- --set plants-working --pages dashboard --reference dashboard=dashboard-v4.png
```

## 3. The differences, one row each

1. The gap under the page heading is 50px; the design has 10px. It comes from
   `h1.govuk-heading-xl`, whose bottom margin is spacing step 8.
2. The status tags are green or yellow; the design has them blue. They come
   from the `govukTag({ text: row.status.text, classes: row.status.classes })`
   call.

## 4. The mapping

1. A 10px gap is step 2 on the spacing scale at every width. Add
   `govuk-!-margin-bottom-2` to the heading (`figma-to-govuk.md`, "Spacing").
2. Blue is the default tag colour. The codebase's name for it is
   `govuk-tag--blue` (`figma-to-govuk.md`, "Colour").

## 5. The edit (template only)

In `src/server/app/sets/plants-working/journeys/linear/features/dashboard/template.njk`:

```diff
-  <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">{{ copy.title }}</h1>
+  <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl govuk-!-margin-bottom-2">{{ copy.title }}</h1>
```

```diff
-            {{ govukTag({ text: row.status.text, classes: row.status.classes }) }}
+            {{ govukTag({ text: row.status.text, classes: "govuk-tag--blue" }) }}
```

No `.scss` file, no `src/client` file and no controller changed. The "Late"
tag keeps its red: it is a separate `govukTag` call, and the designer did not
ask about it.

If the designer had wanted only one status blue (say "Submitted"), the colour
per status is set where the row is built. In a release that is
`journeys/linear/features/dashboard/view-model/row/index.js`, which is the
designer's own file: override `classes` there for that status. In
`high-risk-plants` the colours come from `src/server/app/shared/kit.js`, which
belongs to the real service.

## 6. A bespoke colour: build the nearest and log the gap

The designer follows up:

> Actually the status should be navy, #1d3f6e, like the Figma.

GOV.UK tags come in 9 fixed colours and there is no navy. The nearest is the
default blue, which is already built. Nothing changes in the template. One row
goes at the end of `src/server/app/sets/plants-working/design-gaps.md`
(creating the file with its heading and table header if it is the first gap):

```text
| dashboard | Status tag in navy (#1d3f6e) | `govukTag` with `govuk-tag--blue` (default blue) | GOV.UK tags come in 9 fixed colours; a new colour needs Sass in the real service. | dashboard-v4.png |
```

## 7. Check, show, tell

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:check -- --set plants-working
```

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:show -- --set plants-working --pages dashboard --reference dashboard=dashboard-v4.png
```

Then tell the designer, in plain words:

- "On the dashboard, the heading now has a 10px gap below it, and every status
  tag is blue."
- "Navy is not a GOV.UK tag colour, so the tags use GOV.UK blue. I have logged
  navy as a design gap for the plants team."

  `http://localhost:3103/plants-working`
- any new accessibility findings from the gallery
- the hand-off line
