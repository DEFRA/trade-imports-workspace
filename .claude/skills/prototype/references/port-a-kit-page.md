# Port a Prototype Kit page

The old prototype built its pages with the Prototype Kit, its own Sass and its
own JavaScript. This reference rebuilds one of those pages inside a design
release here, using only the GOV.UK components the real service loads, and
records honestly how close the result is.

**Read first**: `references/house-conventions.md`, "Templates" and
"Controllers" before building — the same ladder `references/change-the-journey.md`
and `references/match-the-design.md` follow, since a port ends up as one of
those two kinds of change.

## What you need from the designer

- **The old page**, one of:
  - a Kit view file: a path to the `.html` file, or the HTML pasted into the
    chat. For a file in the old prototype's clone, copy it (and its
    partials) with
    `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:kit -- copy <page> --release <release-id> --slug <new-slug>`.
    Save HTML pasted into the chat to
    `~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/.cache/designer/port/<release-id>/<new-slug>/source.html`
    first.
  - a web address of the page on the old prototype (it may need a password,
    in which case ask for the `.html` file or a screenshot instead)
  - a screenshot (a file path)
  - only its name ("the transporter page", "here's the old page" with nothing
    attached): find the source yourself with
    `references/port-a-kit-page/find-the-old-page.md`. It says where the old
    prototype's clone is, and which of its copies of a page is the current
    one.
- **The release** to add the page to. Default: the working release they
  changed most recently. If there is no working release at all, make one now
  without asking: follow `references/design-release.md` section B with the id
  `plants-working`, save it as its own commit as that section says, then come
  back here.
- **Where it goes**: the page it comes straight after, for example "after
  arrival details" (`arrival-details`).

Pick the new page's slug yourself from its heading, in lower-case words joined
by hyphens (for example `transporter-type`). The one exception is a **list**
page (search, pick one, or add a new one): it follows
`references/fake-a-service.md`'s worked example 1, whose names win
(`transporter-select`, and `transporter-select/add` for its add form). Do not
ask anything else: make the obvious choice and say what you chose at the end.

## Guard rails

- Only into a design release the designer owns. Never into
  `high-risk-plants` or `sample-journey`, never into a frozen release.
- Change only files under `src/server/app/sets/<release-id>/` and
  `src/server/app/routes-<release-id>.js`, plus the port's working notes
  under `.cache/designer/port/`. (The prototype-owned service behind a list
  page, under `src/server/app/services/<name>/`, is
  `references/fake-a-service.md`'s to make or change.)
- No Sass, no client JavaScript, no `src/client/**`, no
  `src/server/app/shared/**`, no new `app-*` classes, no `style` attributes.
  What the old page did with them becomes a design gap.
- No test files in a release: skip every recipe step that creates a
  `*.test.js` or `*.fit.spec.js` file.
- Every visible string goes in copy, word for word. Welsh gets
  `'[Welsh needed] <English>'`. The old prototype also covers live animals:
  flag any words that name another commodity (animal welfare, livestock,
  journey logs) or link to an animal-only page, as
  `references/port-a-kit-page/find-the-old-page.md` step 4 says, and ask the
  designer one question about them in the report.
- One old page per run. A list page that needs its "add a new one" page and
  a card on check your answers counts as one port: build all of it in this
  run, as `references/fake-a-service.md`'s worked example 1 does. One Bash
  command per call. Do not commit (starting a release in section B is the one
  exception that saves).

## Steps

The workflow `.claude/skills/prototype/workflow/port-kit-page.js` runs steps 2
to 6 for you. Launch it by `scriptPath`, never by name, with every argument
(there are no defaults; use `null` for no reference image):

```text
Workflow({
  scriptPath: ".claude/skills/prototype/workflow/port-kit-page.js",
  args: {
    set: "<release-id>",
    source: "<path to the .html, the web address, or the screenshot path>",
    sourceKind: "html" | "url" | "screenshot",
    slug: "<new-page-slug>",
    after: "<slug of the page it follows>",
    reference: "<path to a picture of the old page>" or null
  }
})
```

It writes the inventory to
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/.cache/designer/port/<release-id>/<slug>/inventory.json`
(working notes), the fidelity table to
`src/server/app/sets/<release-id>/docs/fidelity-<slug>.md` (in the release, so
it is saved and reaches reviewers and the hand-off brief) and any gap rows to
the release's `design-gaps.md`. Read the fidelity table when it finishes.

If the Workflow tool is not available, do the same steps yourself, one after
another.

### 1. Check it is yours

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:where -- src/server/app/sets/<release-id>/set.js
```

Carry on only if the answer starts "Yours". For `high-risk-plants`, offer to
start a working release with `references/design-release.md` first. For a
frozen release, offer a working release made from it.

### 2. Take the inventory

Read the old page and write down, as JSON: the title, every heading (level and
classes), every component (and whether it was hand-written HTML or a macro),
every visible string and its role, every field (name, type, label, options,
error message), every conditional reveal, every `app-*` class, every link and
every script it depends on. Note anything the page takes from outside itself,
such as option lists in the old `routes.js` or `app/data/*.js`.

Then decide its kind:

- **static**: no form, or only a button
- **data-collecting**: a form that saves answers
- **list**: shows records from a lookup or saved list

`references/port-a-kit-page/examples/transporter-type.expected.md` shows a
finished inventory.

### 3. Build it

Read `references/port-a-kit-page/kit-to-prototype.md` first. Then register the
page with the recipe its kind needs:

- static: `references/change-the-journey.md`'s `guidance-page` recipe
- data-collecting: `references/change-the-journey.md`'s `add-a-page` recipe,
  which uses `add-a-field` for each answer
- list: follow `references/fake-a-service/fake-a-service.md`, "Worked example
  1", from start to end. It places the page with
  `references/change-the-journey.md`, builds the picker and its add page on
  the prototype-owned service, and shows the choice on check your answers
  with ready-made code. Its names and its steps win over anything here.

Place it straight after the page the designer named. Build the template with
GOV.UK macros (`references/match-the-design/components-we-have.md` lists them
with import lines) and follow
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/.claude/rules/templates.md`.
If the page adds a required answer, add it to the release's
`journeys/linear/flow/fixtures/happy-path.json`.

### 4. Check it

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:check -- --set <release-id> --full
```

If it fails, fix what the port caused and run it again, at most 3 times. Then
stop, leave the files as they are, and explain in plain words what is still
failing. Offer to undo the port (`references/share-my-change.md` can throw
the changes away).

### 5. Show it beside the original

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:show -- --set <release-id> --pages <slug>,notification-view --reference <slug>=<picture of the old page> --errors --mobile --before
```

Leave out `--reference` when there is no picture of the old page. For a list
page, add its add form and the page after adding:
`--url "notifications/{notification}/<slug>/add"`. `--before` gives check your
answers a before picture; the new page itself did not exist before, and the
gallery says so ("this page did not exist before the change") rather than
picturing an error page. Open the new screenshots and look at them,
including the phone width one: a table wider than four columns runs off the
edge (`references/fake-a-service/fake-a-service.md`'s worked example 1, step
4, shows how to fold extra columns into one cell).

The add-then-back side trip (add a new one, land back on the list with it
ticked) is a form sent and a page followed, which `designer:show` cannot
drive. Check it is wired by reading the add page's `POST` handler (it
redirects to the list with `?selected=`), and picture the list with that
address: `--url "notifications/{notification}/<slug>?selected=<a starter id>"`
shows what the user lands on. Say that the round trip itself was not clicked
through.

### 6. Grade the fidelity

Make one row for each thing in the inventory: what the old page had, what the
new page has, and a verdict:

- **matched**: the same thing, built with a GOV.UK macro or class
- **nearest**: the nearest GOV.UK option, visibly different
- **gap**: nothing could be built

Use `references/match-the-design/nearest-equivalent.md` to judge the nearest
option. Add a row to the release's `design-gaps.md` (format:
`references/match-the-design/design-gaps.md`) for every "nearest" or "gap"
whose difference shows on screen.

### 7. Tell the designer

In plain English, short:

- the new page's link, for example
  `http://localhost:3103/<release-id>`, and where it sits in the journey
- the fidelity table, and where it is saved in the release
- what was left out and logged as a design gap
- any accessibility findings from the gallery
- "The Welsh for this page is marked '[Welsh needed]'."
- then this line, exactly: "If this should become part of the real service,
  say 'hand this to the real team' and I will prepare a brief and a patch for
  the plants-frontend team. The design gaps go with it."

Do not commit. The designer saves their work with `references/share-my-change.md`.

## Before every save

Run the conventions pass (`references/conventions-pass.md`) before
`designer:save`.

## Trying it out

`references/port-a-kit-page/examples/transporter-type.kit.html` is a real page
from the old prototype, made to stand alone. Port it into a scratch release
and compare the result with
`references/port-a-kit-page/examples/transporter-type.expected.md`.
