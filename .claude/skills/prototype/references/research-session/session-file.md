# research-session.json

The tasks for a research round, kept in the research release at
`src/server/app/sets/<set-id>/research-session.json` (inside
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/`).
`designer:research -- sheet <set-id>` reads it to make the participant sheet.
It is an ordinary file in the release: save it with
`references/share-my-change.md` like any other change. It is **not** part of
research mode, so turning research mode off leaves it alone.

| Field              | Needed | What it is                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`            | no     | The sheet's heading. Defaults to "Research session: <set-id>".                                                                                                                                                         |
| `sessionDate`      | no     | Shown under the heading, as the designer writes it.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `deployedUrl`      | no     | The deployed prototype's address. Without it the sheet leaves the deployed links blank. `--deployed-url` on the command line wins over it.                                                                             |
| `tasks`            | yes    | One entry per task, in the order participants do them.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tasks[].title`    | yes    | What the task is, in the words the facilitator uses.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `tasks[].example`  | no     | The id (`slug`) of the example that stops at the task's starting page. The sheet links to `/examples/<set-id>/<example>`, which keeps working after a restart. Without it, the task starts on the release's dashboard. |
| `tasks[].startsOn` | no     | The page the task starts on, shown on the sheet as a reminder.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `tasks[].notes`    | no     | Anything the facilitator should know.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Check each `example` id is real with
`npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:examples -- links <set-id>`.
