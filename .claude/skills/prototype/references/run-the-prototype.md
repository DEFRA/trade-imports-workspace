# Run the prototype

You are helping an interaction or content designer run the prototype on their
own computer. They know HTML, Nunjucks and the GOV.UK Design System. They are
not JavaScript developers. Reply in GDS plain English: short sentences,
active voice, no jargon without a plain explanation.

Say "the prototype", "your design release" and "the prototypes page" (the
page at `http://localhost:3103/` that lists every set), not "server", "set
plugin" or "chooser".

The prototype runs standalone: its `dev` script (or `designer:fresh`) inside
`~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/`,
on its own stubs. **The docker stack is never needed to see a change** — do
not start it, wait on it, or mention it unless the designer asks about the
INS address-book link (below) or a CDP deploy.

## Guard rails

- **Never stop a program without asking.** If port 3103 is in use, say which
  program holds it and ask before stopping anything. Never run `kill`,
  `pkill` or `lsof ... | xargs kill`.
- **Install only with `tim workspace install --repo trade-imports-plants-prototype`.**
  Never `npm install` or a bare `npm ci`: a newer npm can refuse this
  project's lock file.
- **One Bash command per call.** No `&&`, `;` or `|`.
- **This reference changes no files.** It runs, installs and explains. If the
  designer then asks for a change, follow the reference for that change.
  Before editing any file, that reference runs
  `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:where -- <path>`
  and checks `overrides.json`: anything not in its `ours` list belongs to the
  real service and is never edited on a `design/*` branch.

## New here

When the designer says they are new, or asks "what can I do here?", "where do
I start?" or "how does this work?":

1. Run `tim prototype setup` (once per new designer, or whenever a fresh
   checkout has not been set up yet): it writes the designer marker, checks
   the fetch-only `upstream` remote, installs, and prints a `tim auth`
   readiness summary. If it says the marker is already there, carry on.
2. Run steps 1 to 5 below: check the computer, fix what needs doing, start
   the prototype and give the links. If it is already running, say so and go
   on.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:release -- list
   ```

   When any release's "Real journey changed since" column is above 0, say so
   in one line, for example: "plants-dr2 is 4 pages behind the real journey.
   Say 'I want the latest' to catch it up." Say nothing about it when every
   figure is 0 or the column is not there.

4. Print this table as it is. Never add reference names, file names or
   commands to it: the designer only needs the words.

   | You want to                                   | Say something like                                                |
   | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Have your own copy to change                  | "start a new design release"                                      |
   | Change words, hints, labels or errors         | "change the hint on the arrival page to …"                        |
   | Make a page look like your Figma              | "make this page match the Figma"                                  |
   | Add a question or page, or change the order   | "add a question asking whether the plants were grown under glass" |
   | Show a feature the real service does not have | "importers should be able to save a vehicle they use a lot"       |
   | Fill the dashboard with examples              | "show a few late notifications on the dashboard"                  |
   | Get ready for a demo                          | "we've got a stakeholder demo on Thursday, get it ready"          |
   | Get ready for user research                   | "get ready for research next week"                                |
   | Work through notes from a crit                | "here are my notes from the crit, do all of these"                |
   | See your change                               | "show me, before and after"                                       |
   | Save, share or undo                           | "save my work", "make a pull request", "undo my last change"      |
   | Give the developers a story to build from     | "write this up as a story the developers can pick up"             |
   | Catch up with the real service                | "has the real service changed since I made my copy?"              |
   | Make it real and build it properly            | "make this real and start building it on the real service"        |

5. Then say: "You can also just describe what you want in your own words. If
   I seem lost, say 'use the design skill'." Point at
   `~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/docs/designers/your-first-hour.md`
   for a guided first hour.

When a newcomer also asks for a change in the same message, do steps 1 to 3,
then the change (with its own reference), and give the table and step 5 at
the end of the report, before the hand-off line.

## Step 1: Check the computer

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:preflight
```

It prints one line per check and changes nothing:

| Line starts              | Means                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OK - Node`              | The right Node version (same major version as `.nvmrc`)                   |
| `OK - Packages`          | Installed packages match `package-lock.json`                              |
| `OK - Browser`           | The browser used for pictures is installed                                |
| `OK - Port 3103`         | Nothing is using the prototype's port                                     |
| `Needs doing - ...`      | Something to fix first; the line says what to run                         |
| `In use - Port 3103`     | Something holds port 3103; see step 3                                     |
| `Before you share - ...` | The prototype runs, but saving, sharing or handing off needs this; step 2 |

It exits with 1 only when something needs doing. `--json` gives the same
results as data (a `todo` result with `commands` lists the exact commands).

## Step 2: Fix what needs doing

Do only what a `Needs doing` line asks, in this order:

1. **Node.** Tell the designer the version the line names. If they use nvm,
   they run `nvm install` in the prototype's folder and open a new terminal.
   You cannot change their Node version for them. Stop until it is fixed.
2. **Packages.** Tell the designer this takes a few minutes, then run:

   ```bash
   tim workspace install --repo trade-imports-plants-prototype
   ```

3. **Browser.** Only needed for pictures (`references/show-my-change.md`) and
   walkthroughs, but do it now so the first picture works:

   ```bash
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run playwright:install
   ```

   On Linux this can ask for a password to install system libraries. If it
   fails for that reason, tell the designer to run it themselves.

4. **Real service for hand-offs.** `tim prototype setup` already checks this
   (fetch-only `upstream` remote), so this should already be done. If the
   line still asks for it, tell the designer to run "I'm new" again so
   `tim prototype setup` can fix it.
5. **Git name and email, GitHub command line.** These are the designer's own
   accounts: tell them what the line says and carry on. Nothing is needed to
   run the prototype. Saving needs a git name and email; opening a pull
   request works without `gh` (`references/share-my-change.md` gives a link
   instead).

Run `designer:preflight` again. Carry on when only `OK`, `In use` or
`Before you share` lines are left.

## Step 3: If port 3103 is in use

The line names the program, for example "in use by node (process 4242)". When
it says "It answers like the prototype", the prototype is almost certainly
already running, in another terminal or an editor.

Tell the designer: "The prototype is probably already running. Open
http://localhost:3103." Then go to step 5.

If they say it is not working, or they want a fresh start: first run
`designer:preflight` again, straight before you ask, because the number
changes. The prototype's dev server restarts its program on every saved
file and every git switch or commit, so a number from a few minutes ago is
usually out of date. Then ask with the number it just printed: "Shall I stop
the program on port 3103 (process 4242) and start the prototype again?" Only
if they say yes, stop that one process by its number:

```bash
kill 4242
```

If the preflight then names a different process on 3103, the dev watcher
started a new copy: that means the dev server is still running in another
terminal. Ask the designer to stop it there (Ctrl+C) rather than chasing
process numbers. Then run `designer:preflight` again and go to step 4. Never
stop a process the preflight did not name.

For pictures, nothing needs stopping: `references/show-my-change.md` runs its
own copy on a free port from 3203, whatever holds 3103.

## Step 4: Start the prototype

Start it in the background, so the conversation can carry on while it runs.
In Claude Code, run this with the Bash tool's `run_in_background` option:

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run dev
```

For a research session or a demo that must start from the examples after
every restart, start `designer:fresh` instead: the same prototype, but design
releases keep nothing across a restart.

Then wait until it answers (up to two minutes):

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:preflight -- --wait
```

It prints `The prototype is running: http://localhost:3103`, or says it did
not answer. If it did not answer, read the background output and find the
first error:

| You see in the output                                               | What it means                                          | What to do                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use 0.0.0.0:3103`            | Something else already has port 3103                   | Step 3                                                        |
| `Starting inspector on 0.0.0.0:9229 failed: address already in use` | Another copy of the dev server is running somewhere     | Harmless on its own; if the prototype does not answer, step 3 |
| `Server failed to start` with another message                       | The prototype itself has a problem                     | Use `references/check-my-change.md`; it explains start-up errors |
| `[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes`                  | It stopped on an error; it retries when a file changes | Fix the first error above it (use `references/check-my-change.md`) |
| `Cannot find module` or `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` naming a package     | Packages are missing                                   | `tim workspace install --repo trade-imports-plants-prototype`, then start again |
| `Access your frontend on http://localhost:3103`                     | It started                                             | Step 5                                                        |

## Step 5: Give the designer the links

Name the set they want. If they did not say, use their working release (the
newest set under `src/server/app/sets/` other than `high-risk-plants` and
`sample-journey`), or `high-risk-plants` if they have none.

Print the example links:

```bash
npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:examples -- links <set-id>
```

Then give, as clickable links:

- the prototypes page: `http://localhost:3103/`
- the set: `http://localhost:3103/<set-id>`
- every example link the command printed, with its label

If npm says `Missing script: "designer:examples"`, give only the first two.

**"Open the X page".** Most pages only exist inside a notification, so
`http://localhost:3103/<set-id>/<page>` will not open. Give the example link
that stops on that page (its label says where it stops). If none does, say
so and offer `references/example-data.md`: "Say 'add an example stopped at
the X page' and I will make one." The dashboard is always
`http://localhost:3103/<set-id>`.

The first visit asks nobody for a password: on your own computer the
prototype signs you in straight away.

## Step 6: Explain how data behaves (once per conversation)

Say this once, in your own words, the first time the prototype starts or
when the designer asks "where did my data go":

- **Saving a file restarts the prototype.** Saving a page, copy or flow file
  (any `.js`, `.json` or `.njk` under `src/`, except tests and
  `src/client/`) restarts it. Refresh the page after a few seconds.
- **The real journey forgets on restart.** In `high-risk-plants`, a restart
  empties every notification. Its examples come back on your next visit.
- **Design releases remember, on your computer.** A design release keeps its
  notifications across restarts in `.cache/designer/data/` (git ignores that
  folder, so it is never shared). The deployed prototype does not, and
  neither does `designer:fresh`.
- **Reset puts the examples back.** On the prototypes page, press "Reset this
  prototype's data" under the set. It empties that set for everyone using
  this copy of the prototype and makes the examples again.
- **Example links keep working** after a restart or a Reset, even though the
  reference numbers change.
- **Signing in as another organisation.** On your computer, open
  `http://localhost:3103/auth/stub-sign-in?organisationId=<organisation-id>`,
  for example `example-organisation-b`. Examples made for one organisation
  only show to people signed in to it. To go back, open
  `http://localhost:3103/auth/sign-out`, then the prototypes page. The
  deployed prototype uses the Defra ID stub instead: pick a test user in the
  organisation you want.

## The INS address-book link

The header's "Address book" link points at the Import Notification Service
frontend (`trade-imports-ins-frontend`), which this prototype does not run
standalone. It is the one thing in this skill that does need the stack (or
the real INS frontend running some other way):

- **Locally**: bring up the workspace stack
  (`tim docker dev`, or `make start-ins-frontend` for the INS frontend on its
  own — see
  `~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/docs/reference/workflows.md`) and set
  `TRADE_IMPORTS_INS_FRONTEND_URL` in the prototype's own `.env` (or shell
  environment) to where it is listening.
- **On CDP dev**: `TRADE_IMPORTS_INS_FRONTEND_URL` is set by the deploy
  config to the real INS frontend's CDP dev address, so the link works there
  without anything extra.
- **Every other page in the prototype still needs none of this**: the link is
  a design gap for the designer to be aware of, not a reason to wait on the
  stack before showing a change. Never suggest starting the stack for any
  other reason.

## Step 7: Verify

Only say the prototype is running after `designer:preflight -- --wait`
printed `The prototype is running`. If the designer reports a blank page,
unstyled page or error in the browser, do not guess: ask what they see, or
take a picture with `references/show-my-change.md`.

## Step 8: Next steps and hand-off

End with what they can do next:

- "Make a change, then say 'check my changes'."
- "Say 'show me' for pictures of your pages."
- "Say 'save my work' when you are happy."

For a newcomer, print the table from "New here" instead.

Then the hand-off line, word for word:

"If this should become part of the real service, say 'hand this to the real
team' and I will prepare a brief and a patch for the plants-frontend team."
