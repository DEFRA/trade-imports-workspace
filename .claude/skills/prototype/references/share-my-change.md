# Share my change

Two jobs for a designer who uses git lightly:

- **Share**: save their change as one well-described commit on their own
  branch, and open a pull request when they ask.
- **Undo**: take back unsaved edits, the last saved change, or a named
  change, always by adding a new commit, never by rewriting history.

Talk to the designer in GDS plain English. Say "save" (not "commit"), "your
branch", "your design release", "send it to GitHub" (not "push"). Name the
pages that changed and give links.

## Guard rails

- **One Bash command per call.** No `&&`, `;` or pipes.
- **Never `git add -A` or `git add .`** Stage each file by name.
- **Never `--no-verify`.** The checks that run before every save
  (in the prototype's `git:pre-commit-hook`: `format:check`, `lint`, `test`)
  must pass.
- **Never `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`, `git commit --amend`,
  `git push --force` or `git clean`.** Undo always adds a new commit.
- **Never merge a pull request unless the designer asked for it**, in their
  own words, and it is approved with every check green.
- **Never push or open a pull request unless the designer asked for it.** An
  explicit request in their own message ("save it and open a pull request",
  "then make a PR") is the yes: do not ask again. Otherwise ask first, in
  words, every time. Pull requests go to the prototype repository only
  (`DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype`), never to plants-frontend.
- **Check ownership before saving.** Run
  `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:where`
  and follow it. On a `design/*` branch, never save a file that "belongs to
  the real service" or is "removed", and never save a change inside a frozen
  release. Check `overrides.json` if in doubt: only files matching its
  `ours` list are the prototype's own. On a `handoff/*` branch, and a
  maintainer's `chore/*` branch, every file may be saved.

All git and npm commands below run against the prototype repo, with
`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype`
and
`npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype`.

## Share

### 1. Find out what changed

1. Run `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype branch --show-current`.
2. Run `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`.
   If it prints nothing, say "There is nothing new to save." and stop.
3. Run `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype diff`
   (and read any new files `status` lists with `??`).
4. Run `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:where -- --changed`.
5. Work out the design release: the `src/server/app/sets/<set-id>/` folder the
   changes are in. If the changes are in more than one set, ask which to save
   first and save one set per commit.

Tell the designer, in two to five short lines, what changed: which pages,
which words, which layout, which examples. For example: "You renamed
'Consignment parties' to 'Consignment addresses' on 4 pages of plants-working.
The Welsh still says [Welsh needed]." Count the pages from the change itself
(`designer:words -- find "<new words>" --set <set-id>` lists them), never from
an example.

### 2. Stop on anything that is not theirs

Use the `designer:where` answers:

- **Yours**: fine.
- **Shared with the real service and changed on purpose**: ask whether the
  change is meant. If it is, it needs a `why` in `overrides.json` (the
  maintainer's job): say so and leave the file unsaved.
- **Belongs to the real service** or **Removed** (on a `design/*` branch or
  `main`): do not save it. Say which file, and offer to move the change into
  the design release, or to hand it to the real team
  (`references/hand-off.md`). If the designer does not want it, offer "Undo:
  unsaved edits" below.
- **Frozen release**: do not save it. Offer to start a working release from
  it (`references/design-release.md`) and carry the change there.

Files under `.cache/`, `coverage/` and `node_modules/` are never saved (git
ignores them).

### 3. Get onto the designer's own branch

The same rule as every other reference
(`references/ROUTING.md`, "Branches"), so one request never ends up split
across two branches:

- On a `design/*` branch: stay on it. One branch can hold several saved
  changes, and the release's own "Start design release" commit is usually
  already there.
- On a `handoff/*` branch: this is the upstream route. Save as below; the
  `references/hand-off.md` reference says what comes next.
- On any other branch (`main`, a `feat/*`, `chore/*` or trial branch): make
  a new branch named `design/<set-id>-<slug>`, where `<slug>` is two to four
  words for the change, in lower case with hyphens:

  ```
  git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype switch -c design/plants-working-consignment-addresses
  ```

  Unsaved changes come with it, so the new branch starts from the current
  one. Tell the designer the branch name, and, when that was not `main`,
  say in one line which branch it started from and why (usually: `main`
  does not have the designer suite yet). Never save onto someone else's
  `feat/*` or `chore/*` branch.

### 4. Format and check

1. Run
   `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:format`.
   Then run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
   again: if format changed files that were not in step 1's list, do not save
   them, and mention them as "tidied by the formatter, not part of your
   change".
2. Run the conventions pass (`references/conventions-pass.md`) if it has not
   already run on this change in this conversation.
3. Run
   `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:check -- --set <set-id> --full`.
   This runs the same checks as the save itself, so a save after a green
   result passes first time. If it fails, explain each failure in plain
   words and fix it with the reference `references/check-my-change.md`
   names (at most 3 attempts), then check again. Never save on a failing
   check.

   Skip this run when a `--full` or `--walk` check of this release passed
   earlier in this conversation and no file has changed since (step 1 and the
   formatter found nothing new). The save runs the same checks again anyway;
   running them twice in a row only doubles the wait.

### 5. Save it

1. Stage each file from step 1 that passed step 2, one `git add` per path:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype add src/server/app/sets/plants-working/journeys/linear/flow/section-captions/copy/copy.en.js
   ```

2. Write the message from the change, following
   `references/share-my-change/commit-message.md`. The first line names the
   release, what changed and on how many pages, and ends `; Welsh needed`
   when a `copy.cy.js` in the change has a `[Welsh needed]` marker. For
   example:

   ```
   plants-working: rename 'Consignment parties' to 'Consignment addresses' on 4 pages; Welsh needed
   ```

3. Save it (the second `-m` is the body: pages, recipe used, design gaps):

   ```
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:save -- -m "<first line>" -m "<body>"
   ```

   It commits what is staged. The pre-commit checks run and take a few
   minutes; their output (hundreds of lines of coverage) goes to
   `.cache/designer/commit.log` (in the prototype repo). It prints one line
   when the save worked. When the checks fail it prints "Nothing was saved"
   and the last 60 lines of the log: read the error, fix it with the
   reference `references/check-my-change.md` names, stage the fix, and run
   the same save again. It refuses `--no-verify` and paths after the message
   (a commit with paths runs the checks against a temporary copy of the
   staging area, which the checks' own git tests trip over).

4. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -1 --stat`
   and tell the designer what was saved, in one sentence.

### 6. Send it to GitHub and open a pull request (only when asked)

If the designer already asked for a pull request (in this message or the one
that led here), go straight on. Otherwise ask: "Shall I send this to GitHub
and open a pull request so others can see it?", and go on only on a clear yes:

1. `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype push -u origin <branch>`

   If git refuses (`Permission denied`, `403`, `could not read Username`),
   stop and say plainly: this computer cannot send to the prototype on GitHub
   yet. The designer needs write access to
   `DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype` (ask the prototype maintainer) and
   to be signed in to GitHub on this computer (`gh auth login` sets that up).
   `designer:preflight -- --share` checks both. Their work is saved on their
   computer; nothing is lost.

2. Write the pull request body to `.cache/designer/share/pr-body.md` (in the
   prototype repo) from `references/share-my-change/pr-body.md`. Fill every
   section from real output: the release's purpose from
   `src/server/app/sets/<set-id>/release.json` (or
   `designer:release -- list`), the gallery from
   `.cache/designer/show/<set-id>/latest/manifest.json` (run
   `references/show-my-change.md` first if there is none), the ownership
   answers from step 1, the Welsh markers
   (`grep -rn "\[Welsh needed\]" src/server/app/sets/<set-id>` in the
   prototype repo), and the rows of `src/server/app/sets/<set-id>/design-gaps.md`.
   For the page links, run
   `designer:examples -- links <set-id>` and add `?page=<page>` to an
   example link to open the page that changed, for example
   `http://localhost:3103/examples/plants-working/draft-midway?page=task-list`
   or `?page=notification-view` (check your answers).
3. Open the pull request against the prototype, never plants-frontend:

   ```
   gh pr create --repo DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype --base main --head <branch> --title "<first line>" --body-file ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype/.cache/designer/share/pr-body.md
   ```

   `--repo` tells `gh` which repository to open the pull request against, so
   this runs from the workspace root like every other command here; only
   `--body-file` needs the file's absolute path.

   **Without `gh`** (the command is not found, or `gh auth status` says it is
   not signed in and the designer does not want to sign in now), give the
   designer this link instead, with `<branch>` filled in:

   ```
   https://github.com/DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype/compare/main...<branch>?expand=1
   ```

   Tell them: "Open this link, paste the title below into the title box and
   the description from `.cache/designer/share/pr-body.md` into the
   description box, then press Create pull request." Give the title in the
   reply, and the path of the body file.

4. Give the designer the pull request link, and say: "The deployed prototype
   only changes after this is merged to `main`. Send this link to the
   prototype maintainer for a review and say when you need it merged. The
   pull request's checks include a browser test run; its
   `frontend-playwright-report` download has a video walking through each
   design release."

### 7. Check on or merge a pull request (only when asked)

When the designer says "is my pull request merged yet?", "check my pull
request", "why is my pull request red?" or "merge my pull request":

1. Find it for the current branch:

   ```
   gh pr view --repo DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype <branch> --json state,mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup,url
   ```

   Without `gh`, give the designer the pull request's link (or
   `https://github.com/DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype/pulls`) and stop.

2. Explain it in plain words, one line each:
   - `state` `MERGED`: "It is merged. The deployed prototype has it (or will
     after its next deployment)." `CLOSED`: "It was closed without merging."
   - `reviewDecision` `REVIEW_REQUIRED` or empty: waiting for the prototype
     maintainer's review. `CHANGES_REQUESTED`: say what the reviewer asked
     for (`gh pr view <branch> --comments`).
   - `statusCheckRollup`: name each check that is not `SUCCESS`. For a failed
     one, run `gh pr checks --repo DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype <branch>`,
     then reproduce it locally with `references/check-my-change.md`, fix,
     save (step 5) and send
     (`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype push`,
     step 6.1, asking first as always).
   - `mergeStateStatus` `DIRTY`: `main` has moved on in the same lines. Offer
     to bring `main` in
     (`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype fetch origin main`,
     then
     `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype merge --no-edit origin/main`)
     and settle the clash: a clash in `overrides.json` or
     `src/server/prototype-sets/` is settled by `references/design-release.md`,
     section G; any other clash is settled with the designer. Never force
     anything.
3. Merge only when the designer asked in their own words, `reviewDecision` is
   `APPROVED` (or the repository needs no review), every check is
   `SUCCESS` and `mergeStateStatus` is `CLEAN`:

   ```
   gh pr merge --repo DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype <branch> --merge
   ```

   If GitHub refuses because the designer has no merge rights, say so and
   ask them to send the link to the prototype maintainer. Never use
   `--admin`, and never merge a `handoff/*` branch.

## Undo

First run
`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
and
`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -1 --format="%h %s"`.
Then work out which it is:

- **Unsaved edits.** The change references do not save, so "undo that"
  straight after a change is this one when `status` lists the files that
  change made. It still ends in a revert commit (below).
- **The last saved change**, when `status` is clean, or the designer says
  "my last saved change".
- **A named change** ("undo the confirmation panel change").

This is the one rule every reference follows, so the designer is never asked
twice: **the designer's own "undo that", "throw away what I just did" or
"undo my last change" is the yes.** Do it straight away and say in the reply
exactly what was undone. Ask one question only when the words fit more than
one of the three (unsaved edits from two different changes, say), or when a
named change matches more than one commit.

Nothing is ever lost, and every undo is the same kind of thing: a change
saved, then a new "Revert" commit that reverses it. The history shows both,
and the designer can see and bring back either one. Unsaved edits are saved
first, then reversed, so "undo that" straight after a change gives a revert
commit whether or not the change was saved.

### Unsaved edits ("undo that", "throw away what I just did")

1. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
   and list the changed files in plain words (page and what kind of file).
2. Take the files of the change being undone: all of them when every
   unsaved file came from that change, otherwise only the ones it made (the
   change reference's report names them). Ask only when you cannot tell.
3. Save exactly those files as the change, with the Share steps: step 2
   (only files that are "Yours"), step 3 (branch), step 5 (stage each by
   name, then `designer:save` with the message written from the change).
   Skip step 4's `--full` run: the save runs the same checks.
4. Then reverse it with a revert commit, through `designer:save` like every
   other save:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype revert --no-commit HEAD
   ```

   ```
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:save -- -m "Revert \"<first line of the change>\"" -m "Undone at the designer's request straight after it was made."
   ```

5. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
   (none of those files is listed) and
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -2 --oneline`
   (the change, then its `Revert`). Tell the designer what was undone, and
   that it can come back: "say 'bring back the change I undid' and I will
   undo the undo".

**When the edits cannot be saved** (a file that is not "Yours", or the
checks fail on the change and the designer wants it gone rather than
fixed), put those files aside instead, and say so plainly: "I could not
save this change, so I put it aside rather than deleting it. Say 'bring back
what you put aside' and I will put it back."

```
git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype stash push --include-untracked -m "undone: <what the change was>" -- <path> <path>
```

(`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype stash list`,
then
`git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype stash pop stash@{<n>}`
for the matching one, brings it back.)

### The last saved change ("undo my last change", "go back")

1. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`.
   If it lists anything, ask whether to save it or put it aside first. Undo
   needs a clean start.
2. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -1 --format="%h %s"`
   and tell the designer what that change was.
3. If it is a merge (the weekly update, or a merged pull request), a
   `Start design release …` or `Freeze design release …` commit, or a
   `Research mode on for <set-id>` commit, stop and say why. A merge is the
   maintainer's to undo. A release is retired, not undone
   (`references/design-release.md` section F). Research mode has its own off
   switch: `designer:research -- off <set-id>`
   (`references/research-session.md`).
4. Undo it, saving the reverse through `designer:save` like every other
   save:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype revert --no-commit HEAD
   ```

   ```
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:save -- -m "Revert \"<its first line>\""
   ```

5. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
   (it must print nothing) and
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -2 --oneline`
   (the newest line starts `Revert`).

### A named change ("undo the confirmation panel change")

1. Find it by its message:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log --oneline -20 -i --grep "<a word from the change>"
   ```

   Or list the release's recent changes:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log --oneline -20 -- src/server/app/sets/<set-id>
   ```

2. One match: undo it. Several: show them in plain words and ask which one.
   Never guess.
3. With a clean `status`:

   ```
   git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype revert --no-commit <commit>
   ```

   ```
   npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:save -- -m "Revert \"<its first line>\"" -m "This reverts commit <commit>."
   ```

4. If git reports a conflict at the `revert` step, a later change touched the
   same lines. Run
   `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype revert --abort`
   (this puts everything back as it was), explain that, and offer to undo the
   later change first or to make the change back by hand.

"Bring back the change I undid" is a named change too: its commit is the
`Revert "…"` one. Undo that with the same steps, and the change is back.

The undo commit is saved on the designer's branch like any other change. If
the branch is already on GitHub, offer to send the undo too (ask first).

## Verify

1. `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype status --porcelain`
   prints nothing after a save or an undo (apart from anything the designer
   chose to leave unsaved).
2. `git -C ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype log -1 --format="%s"`
   shows the message you wrote, or `Revert "..."`.
3. After an undo, run
   `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:check -- --set <set-id>`
   and
   `npm --prefix ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/repos/trade-imports-plants-prototype run designer:show -- --set <set-id> --pages <the pages it touched>`,
   read the key PNGs yourself, and describe what the pages look like now.
   After a revert commit, add `--before-commit HEAD~1` to picture the
   version before the undo beside it (plain `--before` would compare with the
   undo commit itself, so both pictures would match).
   Never claim a visual result you have not looked at.
4. After a pull request,
   `gh pr view --repo DEFRA/trade-imports-plants-prototype <branch>` shows it
   open against `main`.

## Hand-off

End every share and every undo with: "If this should become part of the real
service, say 'hand this to the real team' and I will prepare a brief and a
patch for the plants-frontend team."
