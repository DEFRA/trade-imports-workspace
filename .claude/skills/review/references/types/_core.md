## How to review your group

You review every file listed under "Your group" at the end of this brief.
This brief holds everything you need: these instructions, the house rules,
the ticket, your guides, and each file's diff and content at the reviewed
commit. Read nothing else unless the instructions for your type below say
you may. Do not search the repo.

If you cannot judge something without code that is not in this brief,
leave it. A functional finding needs evidence you can quote from the brief.

### Scope

- **Findings come from the diff, widened for code quality.** Flag what the
  change introduces or touches. A functional problem (a bug, security, an
  error path, performance) in lines the change does not touch is not a
  finding, unless the change substantially rewrites that function.
- **Code quality covers the whole file.** Every comment and every name in
  each file of your group, every test title in a test file, and any
  comment or doc line the diff makes untrue.
- One rule broken in several places is one finding, with every line named
  in its issue.

### Evidence

- **Functional findings** (`correctness`, `security`, `error-handling`,
  `coverage-gap`) need evidence: a failure scenario, the acceptance
  criterion it breaks, or the line it fails on. A hunch is not a finding.
- **Code-quality findings** (`naming`, `comments`, `structure`,
  `duplication`, `logging`, `test-readability`, `history`) are real by
  default. Never drop one because it is taste, was there before, is out of
  the ticket's scope, matches a nearby file, or was planned that way. Drop
  one only when the code shows it is factually wrong, and quote that code.
- **Design findings** (`design`) are for the designer, never a code fix:
  where a guide disagrees with the design source, the design source sets
  two things for one element, or it does not show a case the code handles.
  Quote the design source and the code at file:line, and end with the
  question and its options. Where GOV.UK guidance and the page disagree,
  GOV.UK wins: raise it with the GOV.UK end state as the Must.

### Do not add a finding for

- a functional problem in code the change does not touch
- "could be cleaner" with no concrete Must
- a formatting preference no rule states
- missing tests for code the change does not touch

### Severity

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| Critical | A bug, a security issue, a broken acceptance criterion, a behaviour-spec change that misstates the AC or claims coverage nobody checked, an absorbed behaviour change |
| Major | Quality or maintainability, or a missing test for new behaviour. Every `naming`, `structure`, `duplication`, `logging` and `test-readability` finding is at least Major |
| Minor | A guide breach with no effect on how a reader understands the code |

### Category

One per finding, from this list only (any other word is refused):
`correctness`, `security`, `error-handling`, `coverage-gap`, `naming`,
`comments`, `structure`, `duplication`, `logging`, `test-readability`,
`history`, `design`.

### The fix

Every finding's `fix` has two parts:

- **Must:** what is true when the item is done, stated as an end state.
  "One function owns the port label format; every page calls it", not
  "add a guard in ports/index.js".
- **One way:** optional, a change that would get there.

Write it as `"Must: … One way: …"`.

### Verdict per file

| Verdict | When |
|---|---|
| `SAFE` | No Critical or Major findings |
| `NEEDS_ATTENTION` | Major findings, no Critical |
| `RISKY` | At least one Critical |

### Writing your findings: one call

Write every file's findings and verdict to one JSON file, then save it with
one command. Send both tool calls in the same response, the Write first.

1. Write `<review workarea>/findings/<group id>.json` (the review id and
   group id are under "Your group"; the workarea is
   `~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/workareas/reviews/<review id>`):

   ```json
   [
     {"repo": "<repo>", "file": "<path>", "verdict": "NEEDS_ATTENTION",
      "reason": "One sentence on why.",
      "findings": [
        {"line": 42, "severity": "Major", "category": "naming",
         "issue": "One line naming the problem and every line it is on.",
         "fix": "Must: … One way: …",
         "best_practice": "java/modern-java.md"}
      ]},
     {"repo": "<repo>", "file": "<path>", "verdict": "SAFE",
      "reason": "One sentence on why.", "findings": []}
   ]
   ```

   One entry for every file in your group, findings or not.
   `best_practice` is optional: the guide's path after
   `docs/best-practices/`, only for a guide in this brief.

2. Run:

   ```bash
   ~/git/defra/trade-imports-workspace/tools/review/file-review-write.sh <review id> --from <that file>
   ```

   It writes everything or nothing. If it refuses an entry, fix that entry
   and run it again.

### Reporting back

When the write succeeds, reply with one line and nothing else:

`done: <files> files, <findings> findings, <worst verdict>`

Your findings are on disk; the parent reads them there. If you could not
write them, reply `failed: <the error>`.
